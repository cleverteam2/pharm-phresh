2. Promotion/Coupon - Component vs Service
Status:
Proposed

Context:
Farmacy food system should accept promotional pricing and Coupons

Decision:
As the requirement is not clearly states promotions/coupons are location based or global, we have decided to go with Component in a modular monolithic system instead of domain based micro services or micro kernal architecture.

Consequences:
Extending promotion/coupon engine would take a lot of development/testing effort.
