3. Separate queues for Central Kitchen and Farmacy food system services
Status:
Proposed

Context:
Inventory data should be updated to both Central Kitchen and Farmacy food system from multiple locations (Kiosks and Smart fridges) 

Decision:
We will use separate queues for the Central Kitchen and Farmacy food system services so that central kitchen could get the inventory updates without depending on Farmacy food system. This would also allow system 
to scale and parallel process the data. 

Consequences:
This decision will require the Inventory tracker services to send the same information to multiple queues.
